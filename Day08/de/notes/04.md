# Aggregation & GroupBy in Pandas

Aggregation and grouping are powerful techniques in pandas for summarizing and analyzing data.

---

## 1. What is Aggregation?

Aggregation refers to the process of applying a function (like sum, mean, count, etc.) to groups of data to produce a summary statistic.

---

## 2. The `groupby()` Method

The `groupby()` method splits the data into groups based on some criteria, applies a function to each group, and then combines the results.

**Syntax:**
```python
df.groupby('column_name')
```

---

## 3. Common Aggregation Functions

- `sum()`: Total of values
- `mean()`: Average of values
- `count()`: Number of non-null values
- `min()`, `max()`: Minimum and maximum values
- `median()`: Median value
- `std()`, `var()`: Standard deviation and variance
- `first()`, `last()`: First and last values in each group

---

## 4. Basic GroupBy Example

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Team': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C'],
    'Points': [10, 15, 10, 20, 30]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group by 'Team' and sum 'Points'
df.groupby('Team')['Points'].sum()
```

---

## 5. Aggregating Multiple Columns

You can aggregate multiple columns at once.

```python
df.groupby('Team').agg({
    'Points': ['sum', 'mean', 'count']
})
```

---

## 6. Using `agg()` for Custom Aggregations

The `agg()` method allows you to apply different functions to different columns.

```python
df.groupby('Team').agg({
    'Points': 'sum'
})
```

Or multiple functions:

```python
df.groupby('Team').agg({
    'Points': ['sum', 'mean'],
})
```

---

## 7. Grouping by Multiple Columns

You can group by more than one column by passing a list.

```python
df.groupby(['Team', 'Points']).size()
```

---

## 8. Filtering Groups

Use `filter()` to keep groups that satisfy a condition.

```python
# Keep groups where the sum of Points > 20
df.groupby('Team').filter(lambda x: x['Points'].sum() > 20)
```

---

## 9. Transforming Groups

Use `transform()` to return a DataFrame with the same shape as the original, useful for adding group-level statistics.

```python
# Add a column with the mean Points per Team
df['Team_Mean'] = df.groupby('Team')['Points'].transform('mean')
```

---

## 10. Descriptive Statistics by Group

You can use `describe()` to get multiple statistics at once.

```python
df.groupby('Team')['Points'].describe()
```

---

## 11. Tips

- Reset the index after grouping with `.reset_index()` if needed.
- Use `as_index=False` in `groupby()` to keep the group keys as columns.
- For large data, consider using `groupby()` with categorical columns for better performance.
