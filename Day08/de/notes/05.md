# Joins & Merging in Pandas

Joining and merging are essential operations in pandas for combining data from multiple DataFrames based on common columns or indices.

---

## 1. What is Merging?

Merging combines rows from two or more DataFrames based on one or more common columns (keys), similar to SQL joins.

---

## 2. The `merge()` Function

The primary function for merging in pandas is `pd.merge()`.

**Syntax:**
```python
pd.merge(left, right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None)
```
- `left`, `right`: DataFrames to merge
- `how`: Type of join - `'inner'`, `'outer'`, `'left'`, `'right'`
- `on`: Column(s) to join on
- `left_on`, `right_on`: Columns from left/right DataFrame to join on

---

## 3. Types of Joins

- **Inner Join**: Only rows with keys in both DataFrames are kept.
- **Left Join**: All rows from the left DataFrame, matched rows from the right.
- **Right Join**: All rows from the right DataFrame, matched rows from the left.
- **Outer Join**: All rows from both DataFrames, unmatched rows get NaN.

## 4. Basic Merge Example

```python
import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'ID': [1, 2, 3],
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'ID': [1, 2, 4],
    'Score': [85, 90, 95]
})

# Inner join on 'ID'
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='inner')
```

---

## 5. Left, Right, and Outer Joins

```python
# Left join
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='left')

# Right join
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='right')

# Outer join
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='outer')
```

---

## 6. Merging on Multiple Columns

You can merge on multiple columns by passing a list to `on`.

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['ID', 'Name'])
```

---

## 7. Merging with Different Column Names

Use `left_on` and `right_on` if the column names differ.

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, left_on='ID', right_on='StudentID')
```

---

## 8. Handling Overlapping Column Names

If columns other than the join keys overlap, pandas adds suffixes (`_x`, `_y`) by default. You can customize with `suffixes` parameter.

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', suffixes=('_left', '_right'))
```

---

## 9. Joining on Index

You can join on index using `left_index` and/or `right_index`.

```python
pd.merge(df1, df2, left_index=True, right_index=True)
```

---

## 10. The `join()` Method

DataFrames also have a `join()` method for joining on index or columns.

```python
df1.set_index('ID').join(df2.set_index('ID'), how='inner')
```

---

## 11. Concatenation vs Merge

- `pd.concat()`: Stacks DataFrames vertically or horizontally (by axis), does not require keys.
- `pd.merge()`: Combines DataFrames based on keys/columns.

---

## 12. Tips

- Always check for duplicate keys before merging to avoid unexpected results.
- Use `indicator=True` in `merge()` to see the source of each row.
- For large merges, ensure join columns are of the same type and consider setting them as categorical for
