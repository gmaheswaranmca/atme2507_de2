# Filtering & Conditional Selection in Pandas

Filtering and conditional selection are essential techniques in data analysis for extracting subsets of data that meet specific criteria.

---

## 1. Boolean Indexing

You can filter rows in a DataFrame or Series by passing a boolean condition.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'B': [5, 6, 7, 8]
})

# Filter rows where column A > 2
filtered = df[df['A'] > 2]
```

---

## 2. Multiple Conditions

Combine multiple conditions using `&` (and), `|` (or), and `~` (not). Parentheses are required.

```python
# Rows where A > 2 and B < 8
df[(df['A'] > 2) & (df['B'] < 8)]
```

---

## 3. Using `isin()`

Select rows where a column's value is in a list.

```python
df[df['A'].isin([2, 4])]
```

---

## 4. Using `query()`

The `query()` method allows filtering with a string expression.

```python
df.query('A > 2 and B < 8')
```

---

## 5. Filtering with `loc` and `iloc`

- `loc`: label-based filtering
- `iloc`: integer position-based filtering

```python
# Using loc with boolean indexing
df.loc[df['A'] > 2]
```

---

## 6. Filtering on Strings

Use string methods with `.str` accessor.

```python
df[df['B'].astype(str).str.startswith('7')]
```

---

## 7. Filtering on Missing Data

- `.isnull()` or `.notnull()` to filter missing values.

```python
df[df['A'].isnull()]
df[df['A'].notnull()]
```

---

## 8. Conditional Assignment

Use `np.where` or `.apply()` for conditional column creation.

```python
import numpy as np
df['C'] = np.where(df['A'] > 2, 'High', 'Low')
```

---

## 9. Examples

```python
# Select rows where A is even
df[df['A'] % 2 == 0]

# Select rows where B is between 6 and 8
df[(df['B'] >= 6) & (df['B'] <= 8)]
```

## 10. Tips

- Always use parentheses around conditions.
- Use `.copy()` if you plan to modify the filtered DataFrame.
- For complex logic, consider defining a function and using
