## Understanding ETL

### What is ETL? (Extract, Transform, Load)
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process used to move and process data from one system to another:
- **Extract:** Collect data from various sources (databases, files, APIs)
- **Transform:** Clean, format, and modify data as needed
- **Load:** Store the processed data into a target system (database, data warehouse)

### Real-world ETL Examples
- Importing sales data from CSV files, cleaning it, and loading into a database
- Aggregating logs from multiple servers, transforming formats, and storing in a central analytics system
- Fetching data from APIs, converting to required schema, and loading into cloud storage

### ETL vs ELT Comparison
- **ETL:** Data is transformed before loading into the target system
- **ELT:** Data is loaded first, then transformed within the target system (common in modern cloud data warehouses)

| Feature | ETL | ELT |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Transform Location | Before Load | After Load |
| Use Case | Traditional DBs | Cloud Data Warehouses |

### Data Pipeline Concepts
A data pipeline is a series of steps that automate the movement and transformation of data. Pipelines can include ETL/ELT, scheduling, error handling, and monitoring.

**Example:** An automated pipeline that extracts data daily, transforms it, and loads it into a dashboard for reporting.
