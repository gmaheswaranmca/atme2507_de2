## ETL Project Practice

### Mini-project: CSV to MongoDB Pipeline
Build a pipeline that reads data from a CSV file, cleans it, and loads it into MongoDB.

**Steps:**
1. Read CSV with pandas
2. Clean/transform data
3. Insert into MongoDB using pymongo

### Error Handling in Pipelines
Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors:
```python
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    # ...transform and load...
except Exception as e:
    print('Error:', e)
```

### Logging Basics
Use Python's logging module to track pipeline steps and errors:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info('Pipeline started')
```

### Testing the Pipeline
Test with sample CSV files and check MongoDB for correct data insertion. Validate data types and handle edge cases (missing values, wrong formats).
