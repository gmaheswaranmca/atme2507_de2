## 🌦️ Weather API with `requests` in Python

### ✅ Step 1: Get Free API Key

Use **OpenWeatherMap**:

* Go to: [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Sign up and get your **API key** (usually sent to your email)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Install Requests (if not already)

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Python Code to Fetch Weather Data

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your real key
city = "Chennai"
url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric"

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

if response.status_code == 200:
    temp = data['main']['temp']
    weather = data['weather'][0]['description']
    humidity = data['main']['humidity']
    print(f"🌡️ Temperature in {city}: {temp}°C")
    print(f"☁️ Weather: {weather}")
    print(f"💧 Humidity: {humidity}%")
else:
    print("Error:", data.get("message", "Failed to retrieve data"))
```

---

### ✅ Sample Output

```
🌡️ Temperature in Chennai: 31.5°C
☁️ Weather: scattered clouds
💧 Humidity: 74%
```

---

## 🧪 Try with Different Cities

Change:

```python
city = "Delhi"
```

Or even allow input:

```python
city = input("Enter city: ")
```

---

## ✅ Optional: Forecast API, Geolocation, etc.

Once you're confident with current weather, you can try:

* 5-day forecast: `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast`
* Geo lookup by lat/lon: `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=..&lon=..`
