## Data from Web

### Introduction to Web Scraping Concept
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages and parsing their content to collect useful information, often using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.

**Example:** Scraping product prices from an e-commerce site.

### When to Use APIs vs Web Scraping
- **APIs:** Use APIs when the website provides them, as they are reliable, structured, and legal ways to access data.
- **Web Scraping:** Use scraping only when APIs are unavailable or insufficient. Scraping is less reliable and may break if the website changes.

### Ethics and Best Practices
- Always check the website's terms of service and robots.txt before scraping.
- Avoid overloading servers with frequent requests (use delays).
- Respect copyright and privacy laws.
- Prefer APIs over scraping whenever possible.
