## Python Requests Library

### Installing and Importing Requests
To use the `requests` library, you need to install it first:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Then, import it in your Python script:

```python
import requests
```

### Making GET Requests
You can make a GET request to an API endpoint using:

```python
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
```

### Handling API Responses
Check if the request was successful and access the response data:

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Success!')
    print(response.text)
else:
    print('Error:', response.status_code)
```

### Working with JSON Data
Most APIs return data in JSON format. You can parse it easily:

```python
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

This converts the JSON response into a Python dictionary for easy access.
