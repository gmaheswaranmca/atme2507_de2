## What are APIs?

### Understanding APIs in Simple Terms
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs act as a bridge between different programs, enabling them to share data and functionality easily.

**Example:** When you use a weather app, it fetches data from a remote server using an API.

### REST API Basics
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, which are typically represented as URLs.

- **GET**: Retrieve data
- **POST**: Create new data
- **PUT**: Update existing data
- **DELETE**: Remove data

REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it.

### JSON Response Format
Most modern APIs use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to format their responses. JSON is lightweight, easy to read, and language-independent.

**Example JSON response:**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

This format makes it easy for applications to parse and use the data returned by APIs.
