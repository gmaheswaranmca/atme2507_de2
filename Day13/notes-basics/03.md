## Pipeline Automation

### Introduction to Scheduling
Scheduling automates running tasks at specific times or intervals (e.g., daily ETL jobs).

### Using Python schedule Library
Install the schedule library:
```bash
pip install schedule
```
Example usage:
```python
import schedule
import time

def job():
    print('Running pipeline...')

schedule.every().day.at('09:00').do(job)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

### Simple Automation Scripts
Write scripts to automate ETL, API calls, or database updates. Combine with schedule for regular execution.

### Monitoring Pipeline Health
- Add logging to track pipeline status and errors
- Send notifications (email, Slack) on failures
- Check data quality and completeness after each run
