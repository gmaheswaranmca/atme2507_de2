## API as Data Source

### Fetching Data from APIs
Use Python's `requests` library to fetch data from APIs:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
if response.ok:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
```

### Handling API Pagination
Many APIs return data in pages. Use loops to fetch all pages:
```python
url = 'https://api.example.com/items?page=1'
while url:
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    # process data
    url = data.get('next_page_url')  # update for next page
```

### Rate Limiting and Best Practices
- Respect API rate limits (check docs for limits)
- Add delays between requests if needed:
  ```python
  import time
  time.sleep(1)  # 1 second delay
  ```
- Handle errors and retries gracefully
- Cache results if possible to reduce API calls
