## Database Fundamentals

### What are Databases?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases store information in a structured way, allowing efficient retrieval and manipulation.

**Examples:** MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite

### SQL vs NoSQL Explanation
- **SQL Databases:**
  - Use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data
  - Store data in tables with rows and columns
  - Good for complex queries and transactions
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **NoSQL Databases:**
  - Do not use SQL as their primary query language
  - Store data in flexible formats (documents, key-value pairs, graphs)
  - Good for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data
  - Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra

### When to Use MongoDB
Use MongoDB when:
- You need to store large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data
- Your data model changes frequently
- You require high scalability and performance
- You are building applications like content management systems, real-time analytics, or IoT platforms
