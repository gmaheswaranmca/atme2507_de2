## MongoDB Setup

### MongoDB Atlas Cloud Setup
MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service. To set up:
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and sign up.
2. Create a new cluster (choose free tier for practice).
3. Add a database user and set network access (IP whitelist).
4. Connect to your cluster using the provided connection string.

### MongoDB Compass Installation
MongoDB Compass is a GUI for managing MongoDB databases.
1. Download Compass from https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
2. Install and open Compass.
3. Paste your Atlas connection string to connect to your cloud database.

### Understanding Collections & Documents
- **Collection:** A group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in SQL.
- **Document:** A single record in a collection, stored as a JSON-like object (BSON).

**Example Document:**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "city": "Chennai"
}
```
